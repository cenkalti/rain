Installing
----------

If you are on MacOS you can install from [brew](https://brew.sh/):
```sh
brew install cenkalti/rain/rain
```

Otherwise, get the latest binary from [releases page](https://github.com/cenkalti/rain/releases).

Usage as torrent client
-----------------------

Rain is distributed as single binary file.
The main use case is running `rain server` command and operating the server with `rain client <subcommand>` commands.
Server consists of a BitTorrent client and a RPC server.
`rain client` is used to give commands to the server.
There is also `rain client console` command which opens up a text based UI that you can view and manage the torrents on the server.
Run `rain help` to see other commands.

Usage as library
----------------

```go
import "github.com/cenkalti/rain/torrent"

// Create a session
ses, _ := torrent.NewSession(torrent.DefaultConfig)

// Add magnet link
tor, _ := ses.AddURI(magnetLink, nil)

// Watch the progress
for range time.Tick(time.Second) {
	s := tor.Stats()
	log.Printf("Status: %s, Downloaded: %d, Peers: %d", s.Status.String(), s.Bytes.Completed, s.Peers.Total)
}
```

More complete example can be found under `handleDownload` function at [main.go](https://github.com/cenkalti/rain/blob/master/main.go) file.

See [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cenkalti/rain/torrent?tab=doc) for complete API.

Configuration
-------------

All values have sensible defaults, so you can run Rain with an empty config but if you want to customize it's behavior,
you can pass a YAML config with `-config` flag. Config keys must be in lowercase.
See the description of values in here: [config.go](https://github.com/cenkalti/rain/blob/master/torrent/config.go)

Difference from other clients
-----------------------------

Rain is the main BitTorrent client used at [put.io](putio-link).
It is designed to handle hundreds of torrents while using low system resources.
One notable difference from other clients is that Rain uses a separate peer port for each torrent.
This allows Rain to download same torrent for multiple accounts in same private tracker and keep reporting their ratio correctly.

Missing features
----------------

The following features are not implemented in Rain, and this list should not be considered as a roadmap. These features are intentionally omitted either because they don't provide sufficient value for our use case at [put.io](putio-link), or because implementing them would add unnecessary complexity to the codebase. We prefer to maintain a focused and efficient implementation that serves our specific needs.

- [IPv6 tracker extension](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0007.html)
- [IPv6 extension for DHT](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0032.html)
- [uTorrent transport protocol](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html)
- [Superseeding](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0016.html)
- [HTTP seeding](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html)
- [Merkle tree torrent extension](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0030.html)
- uPnP port forwarding
- Selective downloading
- Sequential downloading

Contributing
------------

Rain is primarily developed to serve the specific requirements of [put.io](https://put.io/). Due to this focused purpose, feature requests that do not align with put.io's needs are likely to be rejected. Additionally, we maintain a strong preference for simplicity in implementation - complex solutions, even if technically superior, will generally not be accepted. Please keep these guidelines in mind when submitting issues or pull requests.
